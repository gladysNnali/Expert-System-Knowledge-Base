## Expert Systems and Data Management

In the domains of Expert Systems and Machine Learning, a pivotal distinction delineates knowledge bases from databases, each manifesting unique roles and functionalities.

**Knowledge Base:**

A knowledge base stands as the bastion of domain-specific knowledge, rules, and expertise harnessed within expert systems and decision-making paradigms. It encompasses meticulously structured domain-specific information tailored to the art of problem-solving. In the realm of expert systems, the knowledge base comprises rules and facts that choreograph the orchestration of decision-making processes.

```clips
(defrule allergy
  (symptom runny-nose)
  (symptom itchy-eyes)
  =>
  (assert (diagnosis "Allergic Rhinitis"))
```

**Database:**

Conversely, a database materializes as a meticulously organized vault for data storage, retrieval, and governance. It is the cornerstone of countless data-driven applications, characterized by its efficiency in raw data preservation and methodical querying. The Structured Query Language (SQL) is often the language of choice for manipulating and interacting with databases.

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics';
```
